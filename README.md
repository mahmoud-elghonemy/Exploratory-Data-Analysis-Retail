to solve this problem 

 **We can analyse the data further in 3 different ways**

 1)Sales ,Profit ,Discount Analysis at each Level

2)Product Category Level Analysis

3)Geographic Level Analysis

**solution : OBSERVATIONS**

 **Weak areas where Manager can work to make more profit ?**

- Profits and Sales are not Linear in most of the states.

- Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Arizona, Tennesse, Orgeon, Colorado and Ohio are the loss making states.

- Central region needs to be given more attention.

- Machines and supplies are having less profit and are a loss making sub-category.

- Furnitures are not providing much profit margin.

- Higher discounts are not of much use, the profit are in negative and even the sales are having downtrend after 60% discount.

- The Office Supplies has maximum loss at 80% and 0% discount.

- Furniture and Technology had maximum loss at lower Discount rates

 **What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?**
**1) How to maximise the PROFITS along with Sales improvement?**

- TECHNOLOGY gives more profit compared to furniture category.

- Profits can be maximised if the Ship mode is 'Same day'.

- Western region has more profit margins, by analysing the marketing stratergies the profit of other regions and be increased.

- Vermont state is having high profit margin even though the sales are not high, marketing strategies analysis needs to be performed.

- Discount less than or equal to 50% is having highest sales and profit marging.

- Provide optimal Discount to Technology and Furniture to attract much customers

- The Top 5 Sub-Categories account to ~50% of the Sales, suggesting need for accelerated marketing Strategies or introducing additional Products in those categories.

- In Segments, Home-office has High Profit & sales, suggest to promote more for higher profits

**2) Improve Inventory**

- As furniture has low profit margin and have more storage cost, they can be sold on long waiting period,as people dont prefer to buy Tables and Bookcases from Superstore. Hence these departments are in loss.
- The stock of Office Supplies and Technology can be improved for the same price of Furniture storage.
